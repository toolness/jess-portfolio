## CHALLENGE

It's difficult to ask teens to go into sandbox environments to learn how to edit
the Web.

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

Run hack-jams with the New York and Chicago Public Libraries to user test how
might we design web development learning experiences that meet youth where 
they are on the Web.
 
## DESIGN STRATEGY

Help teens hack the websites that they regularly visit.

## SOLUTION

Design a prototype tool (Hackasaurus) and curriculum to make it easy for anyone 
to uncover and mess around with the building blocks that make up the webâ€”
empowering them to move from digital consumer.

## PROCESS

Both projects were conceived of, designed and implemented with Atul Varma. 
during our time at Mozilla.

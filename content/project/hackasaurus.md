  A playful drawing of the mascot of Hackasaurus, a girl in a yellow
  outfit with a blue cape and goggles. She is holding a laptop and
  it is plugged into the word "remix".

## Challenge

It's difficult to ask teens to go into sandbox environments to learn how to edit
the Web.

## Engagement strategy

Run hack-jams with the New York and Chicago Public Libraries to user test how
might we design web development learning experiences that meet youth where 
they are on the Web.
 
## Design strategy

Help teens hack the websites that they regularly visit.

## Solution

Design a prototype tool (Hackasaurus) and curriculum to make it easy for anyone 
to uncover and mess around with the building blocks that make up the web—
empowering them to move from digital consumer.

## Process

Both projects were conceived of, designed and implemented with Atul Varma. 
during our time at Mozilla.

TODO: Insert goggles screenshot here.

The X-Ray Goggles bookmarklet helps you to look under the hood of a website and then remix the code.

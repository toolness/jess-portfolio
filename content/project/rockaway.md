## Challenge

Local residents of the superstorm Sandy affected community in Rockaway Beach, NY want to be involved in rebuilding - by helping themselves


## Engagement strategy

Co-create hack jams,learning labs, and, prototype rebuilding opportunities.

## Design strategy

Uplevel prototypes to create emergency preparedness tools.


## Solution

Create a crisis response system that builds on top of existing technology used by community based, grassroot and established relief organizations to streamline communications and leverage data in order to develop a peer recognition system that can be used as part of an Emergency Response Kit for cities.

## Process

After losing contact with my family who decided to ride out the storm by remaining at their home, I took the most terrifying ride of my life and drove through fallen trees and unmanned bridges to find them completely traumatized in our destroyed home, but thankfully, safe. After helping them, I set up a website that matched those who needed help with volunteers. I coordinated over 1,000 responders in conjunction with Team Rubicon, Palantir Technologies and other grassroot organizations.
